## Malaria Detection Using VGG19(Transfer Learning):

Library Used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Tensorflow

Overview : Malaria Detection is a lucrative use case in Medical Evaluation. 
The algorithm is based on the 'Malaria Cell Images Dataset' from the 'Kaggle' repository. 

We had evaluated three algorithms namely,
1. VGG19
2. MobileNet
3. VGG16

VGG19 gave us the best accuracy (95%), followed by VGG16 and MobileNet.

Also,  
    Loss = categorical_crossentropy, 
     Optimizer = Adam
